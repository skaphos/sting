# sting

Query a GitHub or GitLab user's commits over a time window and hand them to an
LLM agent (or a terminal) in a consumable form.

`sting` is a single binary with subcommands:

- **`sting init`** — guided first-time setup (strongly recommended).
- **`sting auth`** — authenticate with GitHub or GitLab via OAuth (`auth github`, `auth gitlab`, `auth status`, `auth logout`).
- **`sting mcp`** — runs an MCP server over stdio exposing a single, read-only
  `get_commits` tool.
- **`sting <query flags>`** — prints a Markdown or JSON report locally.
- **`sting install` / `uninstall` / `install list`** — register the MCP server
  with your agent runtimes (Claude Code, Codex, OpenCode, Grok).

Configuration is resolved with [viper] (`defaults < config file < env < flags`),
so dedicated read-only PATs can live in sting's own config instead of relying on
ambient provider tokens.

## Install

```sh
brew tap skaphos/tools https://github.com/skaphos/homebrew-tools
brew install --cask skaphos/tools/sting
```

Or install from source:

```sh
go install github.com/skaphos/sting/cmd/sting@latest
```

Or build from this repo:

```sh
go -C tools tool task build      # -> ./sting
```

## Getting started

```sh
sting init          # guided setup (recommended)
sting auth github   # or sting auth gitlab
sting query --author yourhandle --window 7d
```

## Authentication (recommended)

The modern way to authenticate is with OAuth using `sting init` and the `sting auth` commands.

### First-time setup

```sh
sting init
```

This is a guided wizard that:
- Defaults to GitHub (the primary/recommended provider)
- Can launch the OAuth flow for you
- Sets your default provider in `~/.config/sting/config.yaml`

You can also be explicit:

```sh
sting init github     # GitHub (default)
sting init gitlab     # GitLab
```

### Manual authentication

```sh
# GitHub (uses the public Skaphos OAuth app on github.com)
sting auth github
sting auth github --hostname ghe.example.com   # GHES / bring-your-own app

# GitLab (device flow, same as `glab`)
sting auth gitlab
sting auth gitlab --hostname gitlab.example.com --client-id <YOUR_ID>
```

After authenticating you can check status or log out:

```sh
sting auth status
sting auth logout github
sting auth logout gitlab --hostname gitlab.example.com
```

### Legacy PAT fallback

Personal Access Tokens are still fully supported as a fallback (especially useful
in CI or air-gapped environments). Note that a configured PAT (`token`/`gitlab_token`
in the config file, or `STING_TOKEN`/`STING_GITLAB_TOKEN` in the environment)
**overrides** any stored OAuth credential for that provider/host — it does not
merely fill a gap when OAuth is absent. Unset it if you want sting to use the
OAuth credential instead.

```sh
# config file
token: ghp_xxx
gitlab_token: glpat_xxx

# or environment
export STING_TOKEN=ghp_xxx
export STING_GITLAB_TOKEN=glpat_xxx
```

See [docs/oauth-app-registration.md](docs/oauth-app-registration.md) for how to
create the required OAuth applications and for important notes about trust,
governance, and when organizations should register their own apps instead of
using the public Skaphos ones.

`sting auth --help` also contains the current recommended patterns.

## Agent integration (the main use case)

Register the MCP server with every detected runtime:

```sh
sting install                      # auto-detect Claude, Codex, OpenCode, Grok
sting install --claude             # just one runtime
sting install --scope project      # write project-scoped config in CWD
sting install --manual             # print snippets instead of writing
sting install list                 # show registration state per runtime
sting uninstall                    # remove entries (prompts unless --yes)
```

`install` writes a `sting mcp` entry pointing at the current executable. Because
`get_commits` is **read-only** (advertised via the MCP `readOnlyHint`
annotation), the Claude snippet also prints a paste-ready `permissions.allow`
block that auto-approves the tool — safe to accept without per-call prompts.

Then ask the agent naturally:

> Give me all the commits of `mfacenet` in the last week and tell me what he's
> working on.

The tool returns structured commit data **plus** a Markdown summary, so the
agent has clean material to describe the work.

## CLI usage

```sh
# Last week of an author's commits, anywhere GitHub has indexed (Markdown).
sting --author mfacenet --window 7d

# JSON for piping into other tools.
sting --author mfacenet --window 7d -o json

# Within specific repos (most complete; works on private repos with a token).
sting --author mfacenet --scope repos --repos skaphos/sting,skaphos/other

# Across every repo in an org.
sting --author mfacenet --scope org --org skaphos --window 2w

# GitLab project commits.
sting --provider gitlab --author mfacenet --scope repos --repos skaphos/sting

# GitLab group commits, including projects in subgroups.
sting --provider gitlab --author mfacenet --scope org --org skaphos --window 2w

# Explicit bounds and per-commit line stats.
sting --author mfacenet --since 2026-05-01 --until 2026-05-15 --stats

# File-level evidence without full patches.
sting --author mfacenet --scope repos --repos skaphos/sting --window 7d --files

# Full bounded diffs for LLM analysis. This implies --files.
sting --author mfacenet --scope repos --repos skaphos/sting --window 7d --diffs --max-diff-bytes 60000
```

Run `sting --help` (or `sting <command> --help`) for the full flag list.

### Evidence depth

The default query returns commit metadata and messages only. Use the evidence
flags when you want an agent to explain the actual code changes:

- `--stats` adds per-commit additions, deletions, and total changed lines.
- `--files` adds changed file paths, statuses, and per-file line counts (and also populates the per-commit totals).
- `--diffs` adds patch text for each changed file and implies `--files`.
- `--max-diff-bytes` caps patch text per commit; truncated files are marked in
  JSON and Markdown.
- `--prs` (GitHub, `scope=repos`/`org`) also discovers commits on **open
  pull-request branches**. Unmerged work is not on a default branch, so commit
  search and branch listing miss it; this enumerates open PRs per repo and
  merges author-matching, in-window commits. Each result carries a `source`
  field (`search`, `repo`, or `pull/<n>`) so the discovery origin is auditable,
  and Markdown flags PR-branch commits with `[pull/<n>]`. It costs extra API
  calls (one PR list plus one commit list per open PR), so it is off by default.

GitHub fetches this evidence from per-commit detail calls. GitLab uses
`with_stats` for line stats and commit diff calls for file evidence. Keep full
diffs explicit because they cost extra API calls and can be token-heavy for an
LLM context.

### Scopes

| provider | scope    | how it finds commits                                             | notes                                               |
|----------|----------|------------------------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------|
| GitHub   | `search` | GitHub commit search by `author:` (or `author-email:` for emails) | global (public-only) unless scoped; 1000-result cap |
| GitHub   | `repos`  | lists commits in each `owner/repo` you name, filtered by author  | most complete; supports private repos with a token  |
| GitHub   | `org`    | enumerates an org's repos, then lists commits in each            | needs org read access for private repos             |
| GitLab   | `repos`  | lists commits in each `group/project` or project ID              | supports nested group paths; GitLab search not used |
| GitLab   | `org`    | treats `org` as a GitLab group and includes subgroup projects     | needs group/project read access for private data    |

GitLab `search` scope is not supported yet. GitLab's search API does not map
cleanly to sting's date-bounded author query contract, so use `repos` or `org`
with `--provider gitlab`.

In `org` scope sting enumerates the org's repos and then lists each repo's
commits. A repo that cannot be listed for a reason specific to that repo — an
empty repository (GitHub returns `409`), or one that is gone or not visible to
the token (`403`/`404`/`410`/`451`) — is **skipped** rather than aborting the
whole scan, so one bad repo can no longer sink an entire org query. Skipped
repos are reported in the result: a `skipped` array in JSON (each entry has a
`repo` and a `reason`) and a **Skipped** line in Markdown. Global failures
(rate limits, auth, server errors) still abort, since continuing would only
retrip them on every remaining repo. The GitLab `org` scope skips unreadable
projects the same way. The explicit `repos` scope does **not** skip: a repo you
named yourself fails loudly so a typo or access gap is not silently dropped.

#### Searching private orgs

A bare `search` is a global author query, which GitHub limits to **public**
repos. To reach a **private** org via the search index, scope the query by
combining `search` with `--org` (or `--repos`):

```sh
# Adds `org:Alaska-Airlines-Shared` to the search query.
sting --author mfacenet --scope search --org Alaska-Airlines-Shared --window 7d
```

`--author` accepts either a GitHub login or a commit email. An email is
detected automatically and queried with the `author-email:` qualifier, since
GitHub's commit search does not match emails against `author:`. Note the two can
return different results: a login matches commits GitHub attributes to that
account, while an email matches the raw commit author regardless of account
linkage.

Two requirements for any private-org result:

- **Token access** — the PAT must have read access to the private repos. If the
  org enforces SAML/SSO, the token must be **SSO-authorized** for it (classic
  PAT) or approved with repo/contents read (fine-grained PAT); otherwise private
  results are silently excluded.
- **Indexing** — commit search only covers default branches and skips commits
  attributed to an email not linked to the GitHub account.

For the **most complete** private-org coverage (not limited by the search
index), prefer `--scope org --org Alaska-Airlines-Shared`, which lists commits
per repo directly. `search --org` is faster (one query vs. per-repo listings)
but subject to the indexing caveats above.

### Time window

`--window` accepts `7d`, `2w`, `48h`, `30m`, etc. `--since`/`--until` accept
`YYYY-MM-DD` or RFC3339. `--since` overrides `--window`; `--until` defaults to now.

## Configuration

Resolved in increasing precedence: built-in defaults → config file → environment
(`STING_*`) → flags. The config file is discovered as `config.yaml` under
`$XDG_CONFIG_HOME/sting`, `~/.config/sting`, `~/.sting`, or the current
directory, or pointed at explicitly with `--config path.yaml`.
