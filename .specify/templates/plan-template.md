# Implementation Plan: [FEATURE]

**Branch**: `[###-feature-name]` | **Date**: [DATE] | **Spec**: [link]

**Input**: Feature specification from `/specs/[###-feature-name]/spec.md`

**Note**: This template is filled in by the `/speckit-plan` command; its definition describes the execution workflow.

## Summary

[Extract from feature spec: primary requirement + technical approach from research]

## Technical Context

<!--
  ACTION REQUIRED: Replace the content in this section with the technical details
  for the project. The structure here is presented in advisory capacity to guide
  the iteration process.
-->

**Language/Version**: [e.g., Python 3.11, Swift 5.9, Rust 1.75 or NEEDS CLARIFICATION]

**Primary Dependencies**: [e.g., FastAPI, UIKit, LLVM or NEEDS CLARIFICATION]

**Storage**: [if applicable, e.g., PostgreSQL, CoreData, files or N/A]

**Testing**: [e.g., pytest, XCTest, cargo test or NEEDS CLARIFICATION]

**Target Platform**: [e.g., Linux server, iOS 15+, WASM or NEEDS CLARIFICATION]

**Project Type**: [e.g., library/cli/web-service/mobile-app/compiler/desktop-app or NEEDS CLARIFICATION]

**Performance Goals**: [domain-specific, e.g., 1000 req/s, 10k lines/sec, 60 fps or NEEDS CLARIFICATION]

**Constraints**: [domain-specific, e.g., <200ms p95, <100MB memory, offline-capable or NEEDS CLARIFICATION]

**Scale/Scope**: [domain-specific, e.g., 10k users, 1M LOC, 50 screens or NEEDS CLARIFICATION]

## Constitution Check

*GATE: Must pass before Phase 0 research. Re-check after Phase 1 design.*

Derived from `.specify/memory/constitution.md` v1.0.0. Mark each gate PASS / FAIL / N/A with
one line of evidence. Any FAIL blocks implementation until the design changes or the deviation
is justified in Complexity Tracking below.

| # | Gate | Check | Status |
|---|------|-------|--------|
| I | Read-only by design | No command, MCP tool, or code path writes to provider state; any new MCP tool is `ReadOnlyHint: true` and registered via `mcpserver.ReadOnlyTools()` | |
| II | Evidence-grade output | Results carry provider, scope, resolved query, and schema version; every failure states a reason and a next safe action | |
| III | Deterministic queries | Same request + same upstream state → same result; time/window parsing normalized at the boundary; bounds and truncation disclosed in output | |
| IV | Explicit config, dedicated credentials | Typed/validated config with flags > env > file > defaults; sting's own PAT keys only (no `GITHUB_TOKEN` / `GITLAB_TOKEN`); no secrets in logs, output, or errors | |
| V | Public packages are the contract | Public API surface (`model`, `config`, `ghclient`, `gitlabclient`) stays minimal; breaking `Commit`/`Result` changes bump `model.SchemaVersion`; no dependency on consumers; inward-only layering | |
| VI | Partial results over blindness | Per-scope/per-repo failures return partial results with an attributable error, never a silent empty result | |
| VII | Never a second source of truth | Nothing persisted that can diverge from provider state; files written for other runtimes are atomic, format-preserving, and touch only sting's entry | |
| VIII | Technical precision, honest scope | Docs describe verified behavior and state limits and provider coverage differences plainly; no marketing language | |
| — | Testing non-negotiables | New behavior has direct tests in the same change; bugfixes ship a regression test; no network in tests; `HOME`/`USERPROFILE` isolated; per-package coverage gate holds (80% default) | |
| — | Governance | PR-only, signed + DCO (`git commit -S -s`), Conventional Commits; ADR added for architecturally significant decisions; `README.md` updated for user-visible changes | |

> **Fill ONLY if Constitution Check has violations that must be justified**

| Violation | Why Needed | Simpler Alternative Rejected Because |
|-----------|------------|-------------------------------------|
| [e.g., 4th project] | [current need] | [why 3 projects insufficient] |
| [e.g., Repository pattern] | [specific problem] | [why direct DB access insufficient] |
