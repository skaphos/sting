// Package buildinfo resolves what a running binary knows about itself.
//
// Three sources, in precedence order: values stamped at release time by
// GoReleaser's ldflags, then the metadata the Go toolchain records in the
// binary, then nothing. The middle tier is what makes `go install` produce a
// version-stamped binary; before it existed, any build that was not
// GoReleaser's reported "dev".
//
// The tiers are complementary rather than redundant. A module-proxy install
// (`go install ...@latest`) records a real module version but no VCS
// information; a local `go build` records the reverse. Neither is a superset of
// the other, so both are consulted.
